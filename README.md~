NamSor API & SDK
==============

NamSor Applied Onomastics API and SDKs (Extract Gender, Extract Origin, more...). Applied onomastics is the science of proper names. Names are meaningful: they can be classified, sorted, filtered, corrected... This project is a placeholder to distribute open source SDKs for NamSor API.

## NamSor Origin API
NamSor Origin API will guess the likely country of origin of a personal name, based on the sociolinguistics of the name (language, culture). This is a coarse grain API, typically for marketing or social analytics.

The method for anthroponomical classification can be summarized as follow: judging from the name only and the publicly available list of all ~150k Olympic athletes since 1896 (and other similar lists of names), for which national team would the person most likely run? Here, the United-States are typically considered as a melting pot of other ‘cultural origins’: Ireland, Germany, etc. and not as a onomastic class on its own.

## GendRE API (Extract Gender)

GendRE is an Application Programming Interface (API) to determine the gender of a personal name on a -1 (Male) to +1 (Female) scale, for a given geography/locale.

The API automatically recognizes which culture to apply when assessing the gender of a personal name. Some examples: “Andrea Rossini” is most likely an Italian name and a male name, whereas “Andrea Parker” is most likely an anglosaxon name and a female name; 声涛周 is most likely male ; “O. Sokolova” is most likely female. Try those:

* http://api.namsor.com/onomastics/api/json/gendre/Andrea/Parker
* http://api.namsor.com/onomastics/api/json/gendre/Jean/Durieux
* http://api.namsor.com/onomastics/api/json/gendre/Jean/Allen

Still, we recommend passing additional geography/local context (as a ISO2 country code), if you know it - as it will improve the precision:
